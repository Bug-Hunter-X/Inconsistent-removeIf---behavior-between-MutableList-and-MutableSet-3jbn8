This repository demonstrates an inconsistent behavior in Kotlin's `removeIf()` function when used with `MutableList` and `MutableSet`.  The `bug.kt` file shows the unexpected behavior, and `bugSolution.kt` demonstrates a way to handle this inconsistency, providing a consistent approach for removing elements from collections based on a predicate.
